It is a Terminal based application with a MySQL database.
# Problem Solved
A good amount of money is demanded in online courses platforms such as
Coursera or edx so the college students who usually rely on their pocket money
find it difficult to add some courses and tools in their skillset. Often there are
private tutors who want to teach on online platforms but are not able to because
they are not representing any recognized university. There are students who are
good in some courses and can help the professors in teaching, grading the
students, doubts clearing but they don’t get such opportunities in their ongoing
college or job. There are platforms such as NPTEL where students can learn for
free but it does not provide private tutors to teach and teaching assistants to earn
and help the professors.2
# Idea:
We are designing an online course platform that will help students solve this
problem as this platform will not charge any fees if students want to learn from a
recognized university’s professor. Our platform also gives an opportunity to the
private tutors who want to teach and also earn money. The professors from
recognized universities and teaching assistants get their earnings from
government funds (as the government wants skilled youth). The private tutor
charges some money from the students.
Our idea comprises the implementation of an education and learning portal in
which students can choose multiple courses from an optimal pool of catalogue
of various universities and private tutors who are registered on this platform.
Along with this, we facilitate Teaching Assistants to join the platform for helping
out professors in their respective courses and provide assistance in managing
the course. This portal will be of extreme help for students to enhance their skills
at the comfort of their home and the collection of the data online will come in
handy and will make it easily manageable for universities too. EDUAMP has an
upper hand when compared to other commonly used learning platforms in terms
of some of the valid points mentioned below
